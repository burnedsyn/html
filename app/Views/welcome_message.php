<H1>Hello User</H1>
<p>This nft generator let you define the primary order of all your layers.<br>
For this example we use three primary layer in this order.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>Background</li>
<li>Border</li>
<li>Card</li>
</ul><p>
These layers are directory name under ressources directory.<br>
in this case [Background] => /var/www/html/app/ressources/Background/<br>
[Border] => /var/www/html/app/ressources/Border/<br>
[Card] => /var/www/html/app/ressources/Card/<br>
if a directory name end byitsel it is mandatory<br>
if the end is a # followed by a number (represent rarity factor) <br>
under this directory the app randomly choose the next level(path) <br>
and try if it is directory or file if directory is found <br>
the function recursively call itself with the new path as argument.<br>
else the final file is selected for this layer.<br>
and it cycle through all layer defined in configuration file.<br>

<p>At this time it compute the dna of the scene wich is the hash of the clear dna info you'll find later on <br>
and run it against a database of all the scene created before this one<br> 
if it find duplicate entry it call itself recursively asking for a complete new scene<br>
the app will echo something like that

</p>
<p>
    This mean the scene is accepted for the collection and added to it
</p>
<p>
    All layer source are compiled and and image is written to public/build/images
</p>
<p>Now we compute the cryptographic signature of the image file</p>
<p>And we sign it with a collection private key (openssl is used)  <br> we save this signature in a file under public/imgsig<br>
and We verify this signature file through openssl again</p>
<p> we also link all dna created in a global provenance string hash and a local one for each image</p>
<p>Finaly we save all these information on a scene basis in public/cardinfo</p>
<p>
if everything is fine you'll see something like

in case of duplicate dna you'll see something like that

this mean a new scene has been issued and all the process for it was reset.
</p>

or sometime one layer itself is null and in this case the layer will be reset <br>
and the scene will go pass through all the process again to compile it correctly
</p>
<p>
    <h2>finaly you are assured that the defined collection size in config is respected with no duplicate and all information ready</h2>
</p>
<p>
For each scene that has been generated by it you get this p√Æeces of informations at the end of the global process can be time consuming
