# Welcome to Tim's CodeIgniter 4.1.9 Nft Art Generator

Hello User
This nft generator let you define the primary order of all your layers.
For this example we use three primary layer in this order.
1. Background
2. Border
3. Card  

These layers are directory name under  the ressources directory.  
in this case :
* [Background] => /var/www/html/app/ressources/Background/
* [Border] => /var/www/html/app/ressources/Border/
* [Card] => /var/www/html/app/ressources/Card/  

if a directory name end by itself it is mandatory.  

if at the end  there is a # followed by a number wich represent rarity factor.
under this directory the app randomly choose the next level(path)  
and try if it is a directory or a file, if a directory is found, the function recursively call itself  
with the new path as argument.  
Else the final file is selected for this layer.  
and it cycle through all layer defined in configuration file.  
At this time it compute the dna of the scene wich is the hash of the clear dna info you'll find later on  
and run it against a database of all the scene created before this one.  
if it find duplicate entry it call itself recursively asking for a complete new scene
the app will echo something like that

This mean the scene is accepted for the collection and added to it  
All layer source are compiled and and image is written to public/build/images  
Now we compute the cryptographic signature of the image file sha3-512  
And we sign it with a collection private key (openssl is used)  
we save this signature in a file under public/imgsig  
and We verify this signature file through openssl again  
we also link all dna created in a global provenance string hash and a local one for each image  
Finaly we save all these information on a scene basis in public/cardinfo  
if everything is fine you'll see something like

this mean a new scene has been issued and all the process for it was reset.
or sometime one layer itself is null and in this case the layer will be reset
and the scene will go pass through all the process again to compile it correctly  
## finaly you are assured that the defined collection size in config is respected with no duplicate and all information ready  
Provenance Cumulative String please save this information followed by the Provenance Cumulative String wich is each dnahash concatened with the next one
